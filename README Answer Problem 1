Problem 1 – Step 1

`ls ; date` runs two separate commands because `;` is a command separator.  
`ls ";" date` treats `;` and `date` as filenames passed to `ls`, so it behaves differently.

Problem 1 – Step 6

The `-p` option creates parent directories as needed.  
Brace expansion `{}` allows creating multiple directories in one command.

Problem 1 – umask

`umask` sets default permission masks.  
After changing umask, newly created files have more restrictive permissions.

Problem 1 – Links

The hard link still works because it points to the same inode.  
The symbolic link breaks because it references the deleted filename.

Problem 1 – diff vs cmp

`diff` shows line-by-line differences.  
`cmp` reports the first byte where files differ.
